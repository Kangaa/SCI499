In this class of models, individuals can be in a finite number of discrete states. Some of these states are simply labels that specify the various traits of individuals. Of these, some will be changing with time, such as age class, and others will be fixed, such as sex or species. Other states indicate the progress of an infection: for example, an individual can upon becoming infected, typically first enter a state of latency, then progress to a state of infectiousness, and then lose infected status to progress to a recovered/immune state. With each state one can associate the subpopulation of individuals who are in that particular state at the given time (e.g. a female in a latent state of infection). Often the same symbol is used as a label for a state and to denote the corresponding subpopulation size, either as a fraction or as a number (e.g. I or Y for individuals in an infectious state)\" - @diekmann2010\n\n### The SIR compartmental model\n\nThe simplest comparmental model of infectious disease spread is the SIR Compartmental Model, with three compartments: S - for individuals *susceptible* to the disease; I - for *infected* individuals; and R - for previously infected individuals who have *recovered* (or been otherwise *removed* from that compartment).\n\nIndividuals move between compartments in a fixed set of ways, they may either become infected (moving from S -\\> I), or recover from infection (I -\\> R). Thus, an SIR model can be represented by the schematic in @fig-SIR\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\n%%| label: fig-SIR\n%%| fig-cap: \"Graphical representation of SIR model\"\n\nflowchart LR\n    S --> I\n    I --> R\n```\n\n\n\nThe SER model can be extended in important ways to more realistically model different disease processes and factors (e.g. by yhe addition of more compartments )\n\n\n\n```{latex}\n\\boldsymbol{P}^{\\prime}(t)=\\boldsymbol{P}(t) \\boldsymbol{Q}\n```\n\n",
