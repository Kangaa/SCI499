The patches used in the example were based on the 'SA3' regions of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard's Statistical Areas (SA) classification [@2023AustralianStatisticalGeographya] (comprising forty patches for the Greater Melbourne area in that example).\n\n## Hierarchical Structure of the SA classification\n\nAn important feature of the SA classification structure is that there are multiples scale of classification and that lower levels of SA are hierarchically nested within higher levels. For example, several SA3 regions are contained within a single SA4 region, and multiple SA4 regions are contained within the Greater Melbourne Capital City SA (GMCCSA). Moreover, each SA3 region is partitioned into a number of SA2 scale regions (in the case of he GMCCSA, 361 of them), which in turn are divided further into (for GMCCSA, 20xx) SA1 scale regions. @fig-GMelbSA2SA3SA4 shows the SA2, SA3, and SA4 regions of the GMCCSA.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n:::{#fig-ASGSSA layout-ncol=2}\n![](ASGS_Diagram_2021.png){#fig-ASGS width=\"464\"}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-CurrentStudy_files/figure-pdf/fig-GMelbSA2SA3SA4-1.pdf){#fig-GMelbSA2SA3SA4}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nShowing (a) the abstract structureof The Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Areas (SA) Classification and (b) an example of SA3 and SA4 regions within the Greater Melbourne Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GMGCCSA)\n\n:::\n\nFor specific example, the Maribyrnong (SA3) region sits inside the West Melbourne (SA4) region alongside Essendon (SA3) @fig-FootscraySAexample. Both West Melbourne and the neighbouring 'Inner Melbourne' (SA4), containing the city center and other SA3 regions, are part of the GSCCSA. Moreover, within Marybirnong (SA3) there are six SA2 level regions (Braybrook, Footscray, Maribyrnong, Seddon - Kingsville, West Footscray - Tottenham, Yarraville), which can likewise be partitioned in to smaller SA1 level and 'Mesh Block' level regions @fig-ASGS. In @fig-FootscraySAexample, we highlight the SA1 region comprising the main footscray CBD (SA1 code '21303134811'; see @fig-FootscraySA1Code).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Showing the five SA3 blocks that make up the 'Melbourne - West' SA4 region, the six SA2 blocks that make up the Maribyrnong SA3 region, the forty SA1 regionsa that make up the 'Footscray' SA2 region, and the sixteen mesh blocks that make up the central Footscray '21303134811' SA1 region. Note that each red-bounded area represents a higher resolution ('lower' SA level) than the one that encloses it.

For example, SA1 regions are denoted by an 11 digit code which can be decomposed into the higher level areas in which the region sits. @fig-FootscraySA1Code demonstrates this for an SA1 region in the area considered above.\n\n![Decomposition of theFootscray SA1 region code from @fig-FootscraySAexample into its hierachical spatial information components](FootscraySA1eg.png){#fig-FootscraySA1Code}\n\n\n",
