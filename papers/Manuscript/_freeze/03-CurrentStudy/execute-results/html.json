The patches used in the example were based on the 'SA3' regions of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard's Statistical Areas (SA) classification [@2023AustralianStatisticalGeographya] (comprising forty patches for the Greater Melbourne area in that example).\n\n## Hierarchical Structure of the SA classification\n\nAn important feature of the SA classification structure is that there are multiples scale of classification and that lower levels of SA are hierarchically nested within higher levels. For example, several SA3 regions are contained within a single SA4 region, and multiple SA4 regions are contained within the Greater Melbourne Capital City SA (GMCCSA). Moreover, each SA3 region is partitioned into a number of SA2 scale regions (in the case of he GMCCSA, 361 of them), which in turn are divided further into (for GMCCSA, 20xx) SA1 scale regions. @fig-GMelbSA2SA3SA4 shows the SA2, SA3, and SA4 regions of the GMCCSA.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n::: {#fig-ASGSSA layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n![](ASGS_Diagram_2021.png){#fig-ASGS width=\"464\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-CurrentStudy_files/figure-html/fig-GMelbSA2SA3SA4-1.png){#fig-GMelbSA2SA3SA4 width=604.8}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nShowing (a) the abstract structureof The Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Areas (SA) Classification and (b) an example of SA3 and SA4 regions within the Greater Melbourne Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GMGCCSA)\n:::\n\nFor specific example, the Maribyrnong (SA3) region sits inside the West Melbourne (SA4) region alongside Essendon (SA3) @fig-FootscraySAexample. Both West Melbourne and the neighbouring 'Inner Melbourne' (SA4), containing the city center and other SA3 regions, are part of the GSCCSA. Moreover, within Marybirnong (SA3) there are six SA2 level regions (Braybrook, Footscray, Maribyrnong, Seddon - Kingsville, West Footscray - Tottenham, Yarraville), which can likewise be partitioned in to smaller SA1 level and 'Mesh Block' level regions @fig-ASGS. In @fig-FootscraySAexample, we highlight the SA1 region comprising the main footscray CBD (SA1 code '21303134811'; see @fig-FootscraySA1Code).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Showing the five SA3 blocks that make up the 'Melbourne - West' SA4 region, the six SA2 blocks that make up the Maribyrnong SA3 region, the forty SA1 regionsa that make up the 'Footscray' SA2 region, and the sixteen mesh blocks that make up the central Footscray '21303134811' SA1 region. Note that each red-bounded area represents a higher resolution ('lower' SA level) than the one that encloses it.

For example, SA1 regions are denoted by an 11 digit code which can be decomposed into the higher level areas in which the region sits. @fig-FootscraySA1Code demonstrates this for an SA1 region in the area considered above.\n\n![Decomposition of theFootscray SA1 region code from @fig-FootscraySAexample into its hierachical spatial information components](FootscraySA1eg.png){#fig-FootscraySA1Code}\n\n## Spatial resolution of metapopulation models\n\nWe can exploit this hierarchical structure by creating meta-population models incorporating the same overarching spatial structure (i.e. the ASGS Statistical Areas structure), but with varying levels of resolution (e.g. by using SA2 scale patches instead of SA3 scale patches). Thus, we can model the GMGCSSA using patches corresponding to different levels of the SA hierarchy.\n\n### Homogenous mixing in metapopulation models\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nWe might initially consider the models with patch sizes 2, 3, 4 (for SA2, SA3, SA4), and construct a mixing matrix with uniform mixing across patches, i.e. $$\n\\phi_{ij} = \\frac{1}{P_{tot}}\n$$ Where $P_{tot}$ is the total number of patches. - How should we interpret this mixing coefficient?\n\n### Population proportional mixing\n\n\n::: {.cell caption='Population of SA2 regions in the GMGCCSA'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-CurrentStudy_files/figure-html/fig-GMelbPop-1.png){#fig-GMelbPop width=604.8}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure equivalent representation of aggregate levels, patch population size can be used to scale mixing coefficients, i.e.. for two patches $i$ and $j$ the mixing coefficient $\\phi_{i,j}$:\n\n$$\n\\phi_{ij} = N_j/N_{tot}\n$$\n\nWhich gives mixing matrices shown in @fig-GMGCC_PMM\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-GMGCC_PMM layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='03-CurrentStudy_cache/html/fig-GMelb_PMM_SA2_59229f77c90641b503198dac375c3cb7'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-CurrentStudy_files/figure-html/fig-GMelb_PMM_SA2-1.png){#fig-GMelb_PMM_SA2 width=604.8}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='03-CurrentStudy_cache/html/fig-GMelb_PMM_SA3_c0a8926a8df95a94e7747c70c363a316'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-CurrentStudy_files/figure-html/fig-GMelb_PMM_SA3-1.png){#fig-GMelb_PMM_SA3 width=604.8}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell hash='03-CurrentStudy_cache/html/fig-GMelb_PMM_SA4_d0f5fc134c538599b75ad5b8361d35f1'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-CurrentStudy_files/figure-html/fig-GMelb_PMM_SA4-1.png){#fig-GMelb_PMM_SA4 width=604.8}\n:::\n:::\n\nPopulation proportional mixing matrices\n\n:::\n\n\nWe can implement a metapopulation model using these mixing matrices as described in chapter @sec-MPMspec, to briefly summarise:\n\n##### Results: equivalent models at different spatial resolution\n\n-total size -peak size -Duration of pop prop models with SA2 SA3 SA4 homogeneous patches - Expect equivalence\n\n### Statistical Area Mixing structure\n\nWe can also enforce heterogenous mixing, while simultaneously encoding the hierarchical structure of the SA classification by constructing hierarchical block mixing matrices. To do so, we specify a set of coefficients $\\xi = [\\xi_1, ..., \\xi_i]$ which determine the proportion of mixing occurs at each level of the spatial hierarchy. Note that $$\n\\sum\\limits_{i}\\xi=1\n$$ This coefficient is distributed amongst patches occurring in the same level $L$ region, so mixing for any two patches, $i$ and $j$ $$\nM_{ij}= \\frac{\\xi_{L}}{N^{L}} \n$$ if $$\nj \\in S_{i}^{L}\n$$ but $$j \\notin S_{i}^{L-1}$$ Where $S_{i}^{L}$ is the set of patches in the same level $L$ region as $i$.\n\nTo extend the example from @sec-XX, we can consider a subset of SA2 regions from the GMGCCSA (@tab-MMeg)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](03-CurrentStudy_files/figure-html/fig-Example_region-1.png){#fig-Example_region width=604.8}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nKensington, Racecourse, and West industrial are SA2 regions within the 'Melbourne City' SA3 region, Footscray and Maribyrnong are SA2 regions within the 'Maribyrnong' SA3 region, and Flemington and Ascot Vale are SA2 regions withing the 'Essendon' SA3 region. Furthermore, both 'Melbnourne city' and Essendon are within the 'Inner Melbourne' SA4 region while Marybyrnong lies iside the 'West Melbourne' SA4 Region\n\nTo model these SA2 patches in isolation, we can construct a $7 \\times 7$ mixing matrix, row by row, for $\\xi = \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4} \\right]$as follows:\n\nlet $i =$ `Kensington`. Since `Kensington` is it's own SA2 region, $$M_{i,i} = \\frac{1}{4}$$When $j$ is a region in `Melbourne City` SA3 (alongside `Kensington`), like `West Industrial` or `Racecourse`, $M_{i,j}$ will be a proportion of $\\xi_{SA3}$. For $j = Racecourse$ and $j = West Industrial$ $$\nM_{i,j} = \\frac{\\xi_{SA3}}{N_{i}^{SA3} - N_{i}^{SA2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{3 - 1} = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$ When patch $j$ occurs outside the Melbourne City SA3, but within the `Inner Melbourne` SA4, like those in `Essendon`SA3 $$\nM_{i,j} = \\frac{\\xi_{SA4}}{N_{i}^{SA4} - N_{i}^{SA3}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{5 - 3} = \\frac{1}{8}\n$$ Finally when $j$ is a patch outside the `Inner Melbourne` SA4, like those in `West Melbourne`SA4 $$\nM_{i,j} = \\frac{\\xi_{SA5}}{N_{i}^{SA5} - N_{i}^{SA4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{7 - 3} = \\frac{1}{16}\n$$ thus for the row $M_{i}$, representing the mixing of individuals from Kensington, \\$ sum\\limits\\*{j}M\\*{j}= \\frac{1}{4} +\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} +\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} = 1\\$ as desired.
