In @sec-MossGmelb, we observed the construction of a meta-population mixing matrix from empirical origin-destination (OD) data. The patches used in the example were based on the 'SA3' regions of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard's Statistical Areas (SA) classification [@2023AustralianStatisticalGeographya] (comprising forty patches for the Greater Melbourne area in that example).

## Hierarchical Structure of the SA classification

An important feature of the SA classification structure is that there are multiples scale of classification and that lower levels of SA are hierarchically nested within higher levels. For example, several SA3 regions are contained within a single SA4 region, and multiple SA4 regions are contained within the Greater Melbourne Capital City SA (GMCCSA). Moreover, each SA3 region is partitioned into a number of SA2 scale regions (in the case of he GMCCSA, 361 of them), which in turn are divided further into (for GMCCSA, 20xx) SA1 scale regions. @fig-GMelbSA2SA3SA4 shows the SA2, SA3, and SA4 regions of the GMCCSA.

:::

For specific example, the Maribyrnong (SA3) region sits inside the West Melbourne (SA4) region alongside Essendon (SA3) @fig-FootscraySAexample. Both West Melbourne and the neighbouring 'Inner Melbourne' (SA4), containing the city center and other SA3 regions, are part of the GSCCSA. Moreover, within Marybirnong (SA3) there are six SA2 level regions (Braybrook, Footscray, Maribyrnong, Seddon - Kingsville, West Footscray - Tottenham, Yarraville), which can likewise be partitioned in to smaller SA1 level and 'Mesh Block' level regions @fig-ASGS. In @fig-FootscraySAexample, we highlight the SA1 region comprising the main footscray CBD (SA1 code '21303134811'; see @fig-FootscraySA1Code).

Note that each red-bounded area represents a higher resolution ('lower' SA level) than the one that encloses it. Not Pictured: Boundary of the GMGCCSA."

Helpfully, Statistical Areas are also indexed by a structured code representing their classification hierarchy. For example, SA1 regions are denoted by an 11 digit code which can be decomposed into the higher level areas in which the region sits. @fig-FootscraySA1Code demonstrates this for an SA1 region in the area considered above.

## Varying the spatial resolution of metapopulation models

We can exploit this hierarchical structure by creating meta-population models incorporating the same overarching spatial structure (i.e. the ASGS Statistical Areas structure), but with varying levels of resolution (e.g. by using SA2 scale patches instead of SA3 scale patches).

The resulting mixing matrices will be of different sizes (i.e. 40 SA3 patches vs 361 SA2 patches for the Greater Melbourne region), and to ensure equivalent representation of aggregate levels, patch population size can be used to scale mixing coefficients, i.e.. for two patches $i$ and $j$ the mixing coefficient $\phi_{i,j}$:

$$
\phi_{ij} = N_j/N_{i}
$$

Which gives mixing matrices shown in @fig-GMelbPopMM

```{r}
Gmelb_Popns <- map(
  map(
    c("2", "3", "4"),
    \(x) str_replace("../../data/GmelbSA_X_Pop21.csv", "_X_", x)),
  read_csv) |> 
  `names<-`(c("SA2", "SA3", "SA4"))

MMpops <- map(c("SA2", "SA3", "SA4"),
              \(x){
                size <- nrow(Gmelb_Popns[[x]])
                
                MMpop <- matrix(NA,
                                size,
                                size,
                                dimnames = list(
                                  Gmelb_Popns[[x]][[paste0(x, "_Code")]],
                                  Gmelb_Popns[[x]][[paste0(x, "_Code")]]))
                
                Ntot = sum(Gmelb_Popns[[x]][[3]])
                
                for (i in seq_along(MMpop[1,])){
                  for (j in seq_along(MMpop[,1])){
                    MMpop[i,j] <- Gmelb_Popns[[x]][[3]][j]/Gmelb_Popns[[x]][[3]][i]
                  }
                } 
                MMpop
              })



map(MMpops, \(x){ x |> 
  as_tibble(rownames = "i") |> 
  pivot_longer(-i, names_to = "j", values_to = "mix") |> 
  ggplot()+
  geom_tile(aes(x = j, y = i,fill= mix)) +
  scale_fill_continuous(type = "viridis")})
```

We can implement a metapopulation model using these mixing matrices as described in chapter @sec-MPMspec, to briefly summarise:

### Results: equivalent models at different spatial resolution

-total size -peak size -Duration of pop prop models with SA2 SA3 SA4 homogeneous patches - Expect equivalence

# 

To implement this, we posit two main constraints on mixing between patches:

1\. For a given level of spatial structure,(e.g. SA2, SA3, SA4 etc.), individuals from patches within the same region will have a higher probability of mixing than will than will those from patches in different regions.

2\. This mixing will be proportional to the population size

The main constraint employed was that patches within the same level $L$ SA region would mix together more strongly than those not. Nevertheless, because of a higher level enclosing group (in the case of Melbourne, the state level grouping), we only need to specify a series of coefficients which correspond to the lowest level grouping in which two patches co-occur. Furthermore, to ensure the matrix rows sum to one, mixing is also proportional to the fraction of the population of the grouping region comprised by the patch.

for any two patches $i$ and $j$,

$i, j$ are patches

$S_{i}^{L}$ is the set of patches in level $L$ $N_i$ is the population of $i$ $N_{i}^{L}$ is the population of $S_{i}^{L}$ $\xi^{L}(\delta)$ is the proportion of mixing that occurs within $S_{i}^{L}$ but not$S_{i}^{L-1}$

$M_{ij} = \frac{N_{j}}{N_{i}^{L} - N_{i}^{L-1}} \xi^{L}$ if $j \in S_{i}^{L}$ & $j \in S_{i}^{L-1}$

\## Hierarchical Spatial Metapopulation Model $M_{ij} = \frac{N_{j}}{N_{i}^{L} - N_{i}^{L-1}} \xi^{L}$ if $j \in S_{i}^{L}$ & $j \in S_{i}^{L-1}$
