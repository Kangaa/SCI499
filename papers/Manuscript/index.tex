Epidemiological modelling is essential to understand and predict the
spread of infectious diseases and plan effective interventions. Disease
spread is an inherently spatial process, particularly in diseases that
spread through contact with body fluids, and spatially structured
epidemiological models provide an opportunity to incorporate a wealth of
geographical information into the modelling process. Here, we present a
compartmental meta-population model encoding the hierarchical spatial
structure of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS).
Relationships between spatial groupings are represented in a mixing
matrix, which influences the spread of infection between patches
(i.e.~Patches in the same spatial grouping are more likely to spread
disease to each other compared to patches outside this grouping). As an
example, we model the Greater Melbourne Statistical Area (SA) with
patches representing SA2, SA4, and SA4 level groupings, and
stochastically simulate the course of an epidemic as a Continuous Time
Markov Chain (CTMC). We compare the results of simulations with varying
influence of the spatial relationships between patches (through the
construction of the mixing matrix), different levels of spatial
resolution (which level of the spatial hierarchy is represented by
compartmental patches), and different infectious disease parameters
(e.g.~\(R_0\)), as well as with the results of a spatial compartmental
model incorporating an alternative source of geographic information
(i.e.~empirically derived mobility data). We conclude by speculating on
the potential use of such geographically informed epidemiological models
in the management of infectious diseases.

\section{Compartment Models}\label{compartment-models}}

``Compartmental models are the most frequently used type of epidemic
model. In this class of models, individuals can be in a finite number of
discrete states. Some of these states are simply labels that specify the
various traits of individuals. Of these, some will be changing with
time, such as age class, and others will be fixed, such as sex or
species. Other states indicate the progress of an infection: for
example, an individual can upon becoming infected, typically first enter
a state of latency, then progress to a state of infectiousness, and then
lose infected status to progress to a recovered/immune state. With each
state one can associate the subpopulation of individuals who are in that
particular state at the given time (e.g.~a female in a latent state of
infection). Often the same symbol is used as a label for a state and to
denote the corresponding subpopulation size, either as a fraction or as
a number (e.g.~I or Y for individuals in an infectious state)'' -
(\textbf{diekmann2010?})

\hypertarget{the-sir-compartmental-model}{%
\subsection{The SIR compartmental
model}\label{the-sir-compartmental-model}}

The simplest comparmental model of infectious disease spread is the SIR
Compartmental Model, with three compartments: S - for individuals
\emph{susceptible} to the disease; I - for \emph{infected} individuals;
and R - for previously infected individuals who have \emph{recovered}
(or been otherwise \emph{removed} from that compartment). With the
simplifying assumption of a constant population size, \(N\), i.e.

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-SIR_N}{}{
N = S + I + R
}\label{eq-SIR_N}\end{equation}

Individuals move between compartments in a fixed set of ways, they may
either become infected (moving from S -\textgreater{} I), or recover
from infection (I -\textgreater{} R).

At each time unit an infected individual can come into contact with, on
average, \(k\frac{S}{N}\) Susceptible individuals. \(\pi\) is the
probability of infecting somebody on coming in contact, so
\(\beta = k\pi\) is the average rate at which an infected indivudual
will infect a susceptible. Infected individuals recover at the constant
rate, \(\gamma\), with \(1/\gamma\) the mean recovery time.

Thus, an SIR model can be represented by the schematic

\hypertarget{ode-representation}{%
\subsection{ODE representation}\label{ode-representation}}

Given the rate parameters defined above, the change in compartment
composition over time can be described by the system of differential
equations

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-SIR-ODE}{}{
\begin{aligned}
& \frac{d S}{d t}=-\beta I \frac{S}{N} \\
& \frac{d I}{d t}=\beta I \frac{S}{N}-\gamma I \\
& \frac{d R}{d t}=\gamma I
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-SIR-ODE}\end{equation} Importantly, if the total population
size is known, given Equation~\ref{eq-SIR_N}, R = N - S + I and the
entire system can be described by two of the equations in
Equation~\ref{eq-SIR-ODE}.

EXAMPLE

\hypertarget{limitations-of-deterministic-ode}{%
\subsubsection{Limitations of Deterministic

While Equation~\ref{eq-SIR-ODE} provides a neat solution for the
expected behaviour of a epidemic, it fails to caputure the variability
inherent in a complex process like disease spread.

\hypertarget{stochastic-process-markov-chain-representation}{%
\subsection{Stochastic Process (Markov Chain)
Representation}\label{stochastic-process-markov-chain-representation}}

A Stochastic Process is a collection of random variables, \(X_t\).

\hypertarget{markov-chains}{%
\subsubsection{Markov chains}\label{markov-chains}}

A Markov chain is a sequence of random variables \(X_0, X_1, \ldots\)
taking values in \(S\) with the property that

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-Markov-Property}{}{
\begin{aligned}
P\left(X_{n+1}\right. & \left.=j \mid X_0=x_0, \ldots, X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_n=i\right) \\
& =P\left(X_{n+1}=j \mid X_n=i\right),
\end{aligned}
}\label{eq-Markov-Property}\end{equation}

for all \(x_0, \ldots, x_{n-1}, i, j \in S\), and \(n \geq 0\). That is,
the state at the next time step is determined only by the state at the
current time step.

\hypertarget{time-homogeneity}{%
\subsubsection{Time Homogeneity}\label{time-homogeneity}}

While not a general property of Markov chains, all of those considered
in this work will have the additional property of \emph{time
homogeneity}:

\[
P\left(X_{n+1}=j \mid X_n=i\right)=P\left(X_1=j \mid X_0=i\right),
\] i.e.~the probabilities in Equation~\ref{eq-Markov-Property} do not
vary with \(t\)

\hypertarget{sir-dtmc}{%
\subsubsection{SIR DTMC}\label{sir-dtmc}}

An SIR Compartment model an be described by a Markov chain of two
independent random variables S(t) and I(t) representing the number of
susceptible or individuals infected at time t respectively (as in the
ODE case, a third RV R(t) denoting the number of recovered individuals
is fully determined when the population size is known, and can be left
out from this characterisation).

There are two potential events (tbl-SIR\_Events) resulting in a change
of state i.e.~from \(X_{t}\) to \(X_{t+\delta t}\)

\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-SIR_DTMC_Trans}{}{
p _ {(s +k, i +j),(s,i)}(\Delta t) =
\begin{cases}
{\frac { \beta i s} { N}} \Delta t, & {(k, j) = (-1, 1) } \\ 
{ \gamma i \Delta t}, & { (k, j) = (0, -1)  } \\ 
{ 1 - \bigg[ \frac { \beta i s } { N } +  \gamma i }\bigg] \Delta t, & { (k, j) = (0, 0)} \\
0 & {otherwise}

\hypertarget{specification}{%
\subsection{Specification}\label{specification}}

We employ a basic \(SIR\) compartmental model, assuming no births and
deaths, with a total of \(N\) individuals.
\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-ConstantTotalPopulation}{}{ S + I  + R = N}\label{eq-ConstantTotalPopulation}\end{equation}

We divide the population into \(n\) connected sub-populations,hereafter
`patches', with \(N_i\) denoting the population of patch \(i\) (note
that \(N = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}N_i\)).

Let \(S_i\), \(I_i\), \(R_i\) respectively denote the number of
susceptible, infected and recovered individuals in Patch \(i\) (noting
also that \(N_i = S_i + I_i + R_i\)). Also, since
\(R_i = N_i - S_i - I_i\), we will not explicitly show \(R_i\) in the
equations hereafter (thought this could be calculated at any time)

Individuals coming into contact with an infective, whether within or
without patch, become infected at a rate \(\beta\).

While individuals do not migrate between patches, infectives from patch
\(i\) infect - individuals from \(j\) with a proportion \(\phi_{ij}\).

The force of infection in patch \(i\) given by \[
\Lambda_i = \beta \sum\limits_{j}^{n}\phi_{ij}I_j
\]

And thus the force of infection vector
\begin{equation}\protect\hypertarget{eq-FOIv}{}{\Lambda = \beta I \Phi}\label{eq-FOIv}\end{equation}

Where \(I\) is the vector of patch infection counts, and \(\Phi\) is the
mixing matrix.

\hypertarget{construction-of-mixing-matrix}{%
\subsection{Construction of mixing
matrix}\label{construction-of-mixing-matrix}}

Instead of constructing the mixing matrix from empirical OD data, we
specified the matrix analytically to encode the hierarchical structure
of the SA classification.

The main constraint employed was that patches within the same level
\(L\) SA region would mix together more strongly than those not.
Nevertheless, because of a higher level enclosing group (in the case of
Melbourne, the state level grouping), we only need to specify a series
of coefficients which correspond to the lowest level grouping in which
two patches co-occur. Furthermore, to ensure the matrix rows sum to one,
mixing is also proportional to the fraction of the population of the
grouping region comprised by the patch.

for any two patches \(i\) and \(j\),

\(i, j\) are patches

\(S_{i}^{L}\) is the set of patches in level \(L\) \(N_i\) is the
population of \(i\) \(N_{i}^{L}\) is the population of \(S_{i}^{L}\)
\(\xi^{L}(\delta)\) is the proportion of mixing that occurs within
\(S_{i}^{L}\) but not\(S_{i}^{L-1}\)

The intra level mixing coefficients \(\xi_L\) comprise the vector
\(\xi\). Constraining the elements of \(\xi\) s.t.
\(\sum\limits_{L = 1}^{L} \xi_i = 1\) (where \(L\) is the highest level
grouping) ensures the rows of the mixing matrix sum to unity.\\

-More verbosity

-Be more explicit about SA Levels

-Mention Mixing with PPMM

\hypertarget{implementation}{%
\subsection{Implementation}\label{implementation}}

The model was implemented as continuous time markov chain, with discrete
state variables \[S_{i}(t), I_{i}(t) \in {0,1,2,...N_{i}}\] where
\(t\in [0, \infty)\)

at \(t = 0\), a randomly selected patch, \(i\), is seeded with
\(I = 10\) invectives, such that
\[S_{i}(0) = N_{i} - 10, I_{i}(0) = 10\] and the remaining patches are
disease free \[S_j(0) = N_j, I_j(0) =0, i\neq j \]

at \(t>0\) possible changes in state (`events') are infection at a patch
\(i\) (if \(S_i \geq 1\) \& \(I \geq 1\)), or recovery at patch \(i\)
(if \(I_i \geq 1\)). Rates for these events are given in
Table~\ref{tbl-EventRates}

\hypertarget{tbl-EventRates}{}
\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lll@{}}
\caption{\label{tbl-EventRates}Event Rates}\tabularnewline
\toprule\noalign{}
Event & State change & Rate \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endfirsthead
\toprule\noalign{}
Event & State change & Rate \\
\midrule\noalign{}
\endhead
\bottomrule\noalign{}
\endlastfoot
Infection in patch \(i\) & \(\{S_i -1, I_i +1\}\) & \(S_i \Lambda_i\) \\
Recovery in patch \(i\) & \(\{I_i - 1\}\) & \(\gamma I_i\) \\
\end{longtable}

Due to the Markov property, events occur after a exponentially
distributed time with parameter equal to the sum of all event rates
\[\Delta t \sim Exp(\lambda)\] where

\(\lambda = \sum\limits_{i}^{n}S_i \Lambda_i + \gamma I_i\)

at \(t + \delta t\), a random event from Table~\ref{tbl-EventRates} will
occur with probability directly proportional to it's rate.

When the system enters a disease free equilibrium state
(i.e.~\(I = 0\)), the implementation is complete.

\hypertarget{sec-intro}{%
\chapter{Hierarchically structured spatial metapopulation
models}\label{sec-intro}}

In Section~\ref{sec-MossGmelb}, we observed the construction of a
meta-population mixing matrix from empirical origin-destination (OD)
data. The patches used in the example were based on the `SA3' regions of
the Australian Statistical Geography Standard's Statistical Areas (SA)
classification (Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS), 2023)
(comprising forty patches for the Greater Melbourne area in that
example).

\hypertarget{hierarchical-structure-of-the-sa-classification}{%
\section{Hierarchical Structure of the SA
classification}\label{hierarchical-structure-of-the-sa-classification}}

An important feature of the SA classification structure is that there
are multiples scale of classification and that lower levels of SA are
hierarchically nested within higher levels. For example, several SA3
regions are contained within a single SA4 region, and multiple SA4
regions are contained within the Greater Melbourne Capital City SA
(GMCCSA). Moreover, each SA3 region is partitioned into a number of SA2
scale regions (in the case of he GMCCSA, 361 of them), which in turn are
divided further into (for GMCCSA, 20xx) SA1 scale regions.
Figure~\ref{fig-GMelbSA2SA3SA4} shows the SA2, SA3, and SA4 regions of
the GMCCSA.

\end{figure}

For specific example, the Maribyrnong (SA3) region sits inside the West
Melbourne (SA4) region alongside Essendon (SA3)
Figure~\ref{fig-FootscraySAexample}. Both West Melbourne and the
neighbouring `Inner Melbourne' (SA4), containing the city center and
other SA3 regions, are part of the GSCCSA. Moreover, within Marybirnong
(SA3) there are six SA2 level regions (Braybrook, Footscray,
Maribyrnong, Seddon - Kingsville, West Footscray - Tottenham,
Yarraville), which can likewise be partitioned in to smaller SA1 level
and `Mesh Block' level regions Figure~\ref{fig-ASGS}. In
Figure~\ref{fig-FootscraySAexample}, we highlight the SA1 region
comprising the main footscray CBD (SA1 code `21303134811'; see
Figure~\ref{fig-FootscraySA1Code}).

`Footscray' SA2 region, and the sixteen mesh blocks that make up the
central Footscray `21303134811' SA1 region. Note that each red-bounded
area represents a higher resolution (`lower' SA level) than the one that
encloses it. Not Pictured: Boundary of the GMGCCSA.}

\end{figure}

Helpfully, Statistical Areas are also indexed by a structured code
representing their classification hierarchy. For example, SA1 regions
are denoted by an 11 digit code which can be decomposed into the higher
level areas in which the region sits. Figure~\ref{fig-FootscraySA1Code}
demonstrates this for an SA1 region in the area considered above.
