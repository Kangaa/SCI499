However, real-world populations are seldom uniform in their interactions, leading to the need for more realistic models that account for heterogeneous mixing patterns. In this section, we explore the concept of heterogeneous mixing within epidemiological modeling and introduce metapopulation models as a valuable approach to address this complexity.”\n\nMulti-patch, ‘subdivided’ models\n\nWilson & Worcester (1945), Haskey (1957)\nWithin patch mixing is random, between patch mixing is limited.\nassumptions Sattenspiel (1987)\n\nConstant size\n\nequal birth deaths\n\nconstant recovery parameter \\gamma\nNo permanent movement of individuals between patches\nDisease spread can occur on contact between susceptible individuals\n\n“the total number of new cases is a proportion, \\beta, of the number of contacts”\n“The number of new cases is a proportion \\sigma of the total number of contacts between susceptible and infective individuals, corrected by a factor a, for differences in population size and density among the groups.” Sattenspiel & Simon (1988)\n\nProportionate mixing Sattenspiel & Simon (1988)\n\n“where the number of encounters is proportional to the size of the subpopulations involved”\n“The mixing matrices used are chosen to fit known patterns of incidence, rather than on theoretical grounds; and there is no exploration of the importance of variation in the mixing patterns to the transmission of infection through the population.”\n\n\n\nMixing matrix\n\nMigration matrix Bodmer & Cavalli-Sforza (1968)\n\n“These models use a backward stochastic migration matrix, in which the elements m, j give the probabilitiesthat the parents of individuals in population i came from population j”\n\nMixing (contact) matrix Sattenspiel (1987)\n\n“the probability of two individuals from different neighborhoods coming into contact.
