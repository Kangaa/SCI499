We construct the mixing matrix under the assumption that some proportion, $\delta$ of infections $\xi^{L}_i(\delta)$ arising from a patch $i$ in level $L$ occur between patches in the same level $L$ region, and the remaining proportion occur outside this region. Therefore 

$M_{ij} = \xi^{L}$ if $j \in S_{i}^{L}$  &  $j \in S_{i}^{L-1}$

where
$i, j$ are patches
$S^{L}_i$ is the set of patches in the same level $L$ region as $i$
$\xi^{L}_i(\delta)$ is the proportion of mixing that occurs within $S_{i}^{L}$ but not$S_{i}^{L-1}$
