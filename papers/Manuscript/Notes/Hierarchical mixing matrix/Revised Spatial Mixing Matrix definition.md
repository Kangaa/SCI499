$i, j$ are patches
$S_{i}^{L}$ is the set of patches in level $L$
$N_i$ is the population of $i$
$N_{i}^{L}$ is the population of $S_{i}^{L}$ 
$\xi^{L}(\delta)$ is the proportion of mixing that occurs within $S_{i}^{L}$ but not$S_{i}^{L-1}$

$M_{ij} = \frac{N_{j}}{N_{i}^{L} - N_{i}^{L-1}} \xi^{L}$ if $j \in S_{i}^{L}$  &  $j \in S_{i}^{L-1}$
