## Spatial Metapopulation Model

### Specification

We employ a basic $SIR$ compartmental model, assuming no births and deaths, with a total of $N$ individuals. $$ S + I  + R = N$$ {#eq-ConstantTotalPopulation}


We divide the population into $n$ connected sub-populations,hereafter 'patches', with $N_i$ denoting the population of patch $i$ (note that $N = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{n}N_i$).

Let $S_i$, $I_i$, $R_i$ respectively denote the number of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals in Patch $i$ (noting also that $N_i = S_i + I_i + R_i$). Also, since $R_i = N_i - S_i - I_i$, we will not explicitly show $R_i$ in the equations hereafter (thought this could be calculated at any time)

Individuals coming into contact with an infective, whether within or without patch, become infected at a rate $\beta$. 

While Individuals do not migrate between patches,  individuals from patch $i$ can contact  - and potentially infect - individuals from another patch $j$ with a probability $c_ij$. 

The force of infection in patch $i$ given by
$$
\lambda_i = \beta \sum\limits_{j}^{n}c_{ij}\frac{I_j}{N_j}
$$


### Construction of mixing matrix

Instead of constructing the mixing matrix from empirical OD data, we specified the matrix analytically to encode the hierarchical structure of the SA classification.

The main constraint employed was that patches within the same level $L$ SA region would mix together more strongly than those not. Nevertheless, because of a higher level enclosing group (in the case of Melbourne, the state level grouping), we only need to specify a series of coefficients which correspond to the lowest level grouping in which two patches co-occur. Furthermore, to ensure the matrix rows sum to one, mixing is also proportional to the fraction of the population of the grouping region comprised by the patch.

for any two patches $i$ and $j$,

$i, j$ are patches

$S_{i}^{L}$ is the set of patches in level $L$ $N_i$ is the population of $i$ $N_{i}^{L}$ is the population of $S_{i}^{L}$ $\xi^{L}(\delta)$ is the proportion of mixing that occurs within $S_{i}^{L}$ but not$S_{i}^{L-1}$

$M_{ij} = \frac{N_{j}}{N_{i}^{L} - N_{i}^{L-1}} \xi^{L}$ if $j \in S_{i}^{L}$ & $j \in S_{i}^{L-1}$

## Implementation 

The model was implemented as continuous time markov chain, with discrete state variables
$$S_{i}(t), I_{i}(t) \in {0,1,2,...N_{i}}$$
where $t\in [0, \infty)$

at $t = 0$, a randomly selected patch, $i$, is seeded with $I = 10$ infectives, such that $$S_{i}(0) = N_{i} - 10, I_{i}(0) = 10$$
and the remaining patches are disease free
$$S_j(0) = N_j, I_j(0) =0, i\neq j $$
Changes in state occur after a exponentially distributed time with parameter equal to the sum of all event rates
$$\Delta t \sim Exp(\lambda)$$
where 

$\lambda = \sum\limits_{i}^{n}S_i$
