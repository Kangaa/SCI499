    "text": "Epidemiological modelling is essential to understand and predict the spread of infectious diseases and plan effective interventions. Disease spread is an inherently spatial process, particularly in diseases that spread through contact with body fluids, and spatially structured epidemiological models provide an opportunity to incorporate a wealth of geographical information into the modelling process. Here, we present a compartmental meta-population model encoding the hierarchical spatial structure of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Relationships between spatial groupings are represented in a mixing matrix, which influences the spread of infection between patches (i.e. Patches in the same spatial grouping are more likely to spread disease to each other compared to patches outside this grouping). As an example, we model the Greater Melbourne Statistical Area (SA) with patches representing SA2, SA4, and SA4 level groupings, and stochastically simulate the course of an epidemic as a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC). We compare the results of simulations with varying influence of the spatial relationships between patches (through the construction of the mixing matrix), different levels of spatial resolution (which level of the spatial hierarchy is represented by compartmental patches), and different infectious disease parameters (e.g. R_0), as well as with the results of a spatial compartmental model incorporating an alternative source of geographic information (i.e. empirically derived mobility data). We conclude by speculating on the potential use of such geographically informed epidemiological models in the management of infectious diseases."

    "text": "3.1 Stochastic processes\nA Stochastic Process is a collection of random variables, X(t). In the case of a compartmental SIR model ?sec-ref, the state of the model at time t can be represented by the number of individuals in the Susceptible and Infected compartments, i.e. \nX(t) = S(t) + I(t)\n Where S(t), I(t) \\in \\{0,1,2, \\ldots, N\\}, S(t) + I(t) \\leq N, and t\\in [0,\\infty)\nWe can represent the probability of a transitioning one particular state x = (s, i)1 to another x = (s+k, i+j) (i.e. due to infection or recovery) after a time \\Delta t &gt; 0, as\n\nP(X(t+\\Delta t) =(s+k, i+j) \\mid(S(t), I(t))=(s, i))\n\nWe will make two assumptions about the probability of states, P(X(t)):\n\nTime Homogeneity \nP\\left(X(t+\\Delta t)=j \\mid X(t)=i\\right)=P\\left(X(t)=j \\mid X(0)=i\\right)\n\nWhich states that the transition probabilities depend on the time between events, \\Delta t, but not on the specific time t.\nMemorylessness (Markov Property) \nP(X(t+\\Delta t) = j \\mid X(t) = i, X(u) = k, 0 \\leq u &lt; t ) = P(X(t+\\Delta t) = j \\mid X(t) = i)\nWhich states that the probability of transitioning from a state i at time t to a state j at time (t+\\Delta t) depends on the state at t and not on any previous state.\n\nRepresenting our compartmental model as such a ‘Time Homogeneous Markov Chain’ means that we can succinctly describe the probabilities of possible state transitions (‘events’) because they only depend on the intervening time (\\Delta t) and the current state x_t = (s_t, i_t).\n\n\nTable 3.1: Transition events in a SIR time homogeneous markov chain\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEvent\nChange (\\Delta S , \\Delta I)\nProbability\n\n\n\n\nInfection\n(-1,+1)\n\\beta i \\frac{s}{N} \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)\n\n\nRecovery\n(0,-1)\n\\gamma i \\Delta t + o(\\Delta t)\n\n\n\n\nTime homogeneity and the markov property allow us to define the ‘transition function’ p_{ij}(t), which gives the probabilty of transitioning from state i to state j after time t\np_{ij} = P(X(t) = P(X(t) = j \\mid X(0) = i)\nand represent the possible state transition probabilities for our SIR model as \np_{(s, i),(s+k, i+j)}(\\Delta t)= \\begin{cases}\\beta i \\frac{s}{N} \\Delta t+o(\\Delta t), & (k, j)=(-1,+1) \\\\ \\gamma i \\Delta t+o(\\Delta t), & (k, j)=(0,-1) \\\\ 1-\\left(\\beta i \\frac{s}{N}+\\gamma i\\right) \\Delta t & \\\\ +o(\\Delta t), & (k, j)=(0,0) \\\\ 0(\\Delta t), & \\text { otherwise. }\\end{cases}\n\\tag{3.1}\nMoreover, if we consider the state space of X(t), (e.g. containing all possible comninations of numbers of susceptible and infected individuals (s,i), \n\\mathbb{S} = \\{s, i: 0 \\leq s,i; s + i \\leq N\\}.\n\nFor a particular ordering of this space2 (e.g. (s,i) \\in \\{(N,0),(N-1,1),\\ldots,(0,0)\\}), P(t) can be represented as a matrix specifying the probability of every state transition at time t. Our bivariate SIR state space contains (N+1)(N+2)/2 elements, and therefore P(t) corresponds to a (N+1)(N+2)/2 \\times (N+1)(N+2)/2 matrix.\nWe can now consider the derivative of the transition function, p'_{i,j}(t), which has two forms known as the forward (Equation 3.2) and backward (Equation 3.3) Kolmogorov equations\n\n\\frac{d p_{i, j}(t)}{d t}=\\sum_{k \\neq i} p_{i, k}(t) q_{k, j}-q_{i, i} p_{i, j}(t)\n\\tag{3.2}\n\n\\frac{d p_{i, j}(t)}{d t}=\\sum_{k \\neq i} q_{i, k} p_{k, j}(t)-q_{i, i} p_{i, j}(t)\n\\tag{3.3}\nwhere q_{k,j},q_{i,i}, and q_{i,k} are the transition rates defined in Equation 3.1, i.e. for our SIR model, the forward Kolmogorov equations are\n\n\\frac{d p_{a,(s, i)}(t)}{d t}=p_{a,(s+1, i-1)}(t) \\frac{\\beta}{N}(s+1)(i-1)+p_{a,(s, i+1)}(t) \\gamma(i+1)-p_{a,(s, i)}(t)\\left[\\frac{\\beta}{N} s i+\\gamma i\\right] .\n\nand the backward Kolmogorov equations are\n\n\\frac{d p_{(s, i), b}(t)}{d t}=\\frac{\\beta s i}{N} p_{(s-1, i+1), b}(t)+\\gamma i p_{(s, i-1), b}(t)-\\left[\\frac{\\beta}{N} s i+\\gamma i\\right] p_{(s, i), b}(t) .\n\nWe can simplify (Equation 3.2) and (Equation 3.3), by considering the matrix Q specifying the rates of all transitions q_{ij} for i,j \\in \\mathbb{S}.Similarly to the transition probability matrix P(t), Q has dimension (N+1)(N+2)/2 \\times (N+1)(N+2)/2 .\nThe system of equations Equation 3.2 and Equation 3.3, can now be written as dP(t)/dt = P(t)Q and dP(t)/dt = QP(t), respectively. Consideringp′(t) = qp(t), where p is a differentiable function and q is a constant, when p(0) = 1, there is a unique solution p(t) = e^{tq}, we can similarly solve the Kolmogorov Equation 3.2 and Equation 3.3 as as P(t) = e^{Qt} and P(t) = e^{tQ} (when P(0) = I), respectively.\nThus, the theoretically and empirically derived event rates presented in Equation 3.1, along with the assumptions of time homogeneity and memorylessness, allow us to compute the probability of any state transition at time t. This technique can be used, for example, to derive important statistics about an epidemic, such as its mean final size and the effects of vaccination programs Teo (2017), Teo et al. (2021). However, “computing the matrix exponential is often numerically challenging. Finding accurate and eficient algorithms is still a topic of current research” Dobrow (n.d.)"

There are several stochastic simulation algorithms Simoni et al. (2019), but in this thesis, we will use only the original ‘Direct-method’ algorithm put forward by Gillespie (1976).\nOriginally a method for simulating chemical reaction networks, the Gillespie direct algorithm is applicable to many domains of stochastic simulation with discrete state spaces, continuous time, and known rate equations.\nIn general, the core of the Gillespie algorithm takes in the possible state changes in a system, and a ‘propensity function’ for each state change. Random number generation is used to select a particular state change, u and a time interval, \\tau, which can be used to update the state of the system X(t) = i \\rightarrow X(t + \\tau) = i + u (Algorithm 3.1).\n\n\n\\begin{algorithm} \\caption{Gillespie Direct Method} \\textbf{Input:} \\emph{v}, \\emph{a} \\\\ \\textbf{Output:} $\\mu$, $\\tau$ \\begin{algorithmic} \\State set $a_{net} = 0$ \\ForAll{j} \\State compute $a_j$ \\State update $a_{net} = a_{net} + a_j$ \\EndFor \\State generate two random numbers $r_1$, $r_2$ in $\\mathcal{U} (0,1)$ \\State select $\\mu$ such that $\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{\\mu} a_j \\leq r_1 a_0$ \\State compute $\\tau \\gets \\frac{1}{a_0}\\ln(1/r_2)$ \\State update $X \\gets X + v_\\mu$ \\State set $t \\gets t + \\tau$ \\end{algorithmic} \\end{algorithm}\n\n\nIn particular, two random numbers r_1 and r_2 are used to compute mu and \\tau, respectively\n\nr_1 is used to calculate mu by cumulatively adding the values of the propensity function to each other. mu gets the largest value which is smaller than r_1\nr_2 is used to calculate \\tau by taking advantage of the fact that in a Continuous time markov proces \\Delta t \\sim \\lambda e^{-\\lambda t}, where lambda is the sum of the rates for all possible events.\n\nIn the case of our SIR model, the state change vector is given by Table 3.1 column two, and the propensity function vector is given in column 3.We can include the core stochastic event step in a loop which updates the state and time of our SIR model simulate the progression of an epidemic @alg-SIR_CTMC.\n\n\n\\begin{algorithm} \\caption{Stochastic simulation of SIR Compartmental Model CTMC} \\textbf{Input:}$N$, $I_0$, $\\beta$, $\\gamma$ \\textbf{Output:} \\begin{algorithmic} \\State Initialise time $t \\gets 0.0$ and $S \\gets N - I_0$, $I \\gets I_0$ \\State state change vector $v = [(-1,1), (0, -1)]$ \\State propensity vector $a = [(\\beta I \\frac{S}{N}), (\\gamma I)]$ \\While{$I &gt; 0$} \\ForAll{j} \\State compute $a_j$ \\State update $a_{net} = a_{net} + a_j$ \\EndFor \\State generate two random numbers $r_1, r_2 \\sim \\mathcal{U}(0,1)$ \\State select $\\mu$ such that $\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{\\mu} a_j \\leq r_1 a_0$ \\State compute $\\tau \\gets \\frac{1}{a_0}\\ln(1/r_2)$ \\State update $X \\gets X + v_\\mu$ \\State set $t \\gets t + \\tau$ \\EndWhile \\end{algorithmic} \\end{algorithm}\n\n\nAs an example, ?fig-GMelb_SIR_Sim 100 sample trajectories of an SIR CTMC comprising N = 4976157, the population of the Greater Melbourne region.
