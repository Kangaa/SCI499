    "text": "Epidemiological modelling is essential to understand and predict the spread of infectious diseases and plan effective interventions. Disease spread is an inherently spatial process, particularly in diseases that spread through contact with body fluids, and spatially structured epidemiological models provide an opportunity to incorporate a wealth of geographical information into the modelling process. Here, we present a compartmental meta-population model encoding the hierarchical spatial structure of the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS). Relationships between spatial groupings are represented in a mixing matrix, which influences the spread of infection between patches (i.e. Patches in the same spatial grouping are more likely to spread disease to each other compared to patches outside this grouping). As an example, we model the Greater Melbourne Statistical Area (SA) with patches representing SA2, SA4, and SA4 level groupings, and stochastically simulate the course of an epidemic as a Continuous Time Markov Chain (CTMC). We compare the results of simulations with varying influence of the spatial relationships between patches (through the construction of the mixing matrix), different levels of spatial resolution (which level of the spatial hierarchy is represented by compartmental patches), and different infectious disease parameters (e.g. R_0), as well as with the results of a spatial compartmental model incorporating an alternative source of geographic information (i.e. empirically derived mobility data). We conclude by speculating on the potential use of such geographically informed epidemiological models in the management of infectious diseases."

    "text": "1.2 Compartment Models\n“Compartmental models are the most frequently used type of epidemic model. In this class of models, individuals can be in a finite number of discrete states. Some of these states are simply labels that specify the various traits of individuals. Of these, some will be changing with time, such as age class, and others will be fixed, such as sex or species. Other states indicate the progress of an infection: for example, an individual can upon becoming infected, typically first enter a state of latency, then progress to a state of infectiousness, and then lose infected status to progress to a recovered/immune state. With each state one can associate the subpopulation of individuals who are in that particular state at the given time (e.g. a female in a latent state of infection). Often the same symbol is used as a label for a state and to denote the corresponding subpopulation size, either as a fraction or as a number (e.g. I or Y for individuals in an infectious state)” - (diekmann2010?)\n\nThe SIR compartmental model\nThe simplest comparmental model of infectious disease spread is the SIR Compartmental Model, with three compartments: S - for individuals susceptible to the disease; I - for infected individuals; and R - for previously infected individuals who have recovered (or been otherwise removed from that compartment). With the simplifying assumption of a constant population size, N, i.e.\n\nN = S + I + R\n\\tag{1.1}\nIndividuals move between compartments in a fixed set of ways, they may either become infected (moving from S -&gt; I), or recover from infection (I -&gt; R).\nAt each time unit an infected individual can come into contact with, on average, k\\frac{S}{N} Susceptible individuals. \\pi is the probability of infecting somebody on coming in contact, so \\beta = k\\pi is the average rate at which an infected indivudual will infect a susceptible.

Nevertheless, because of a higher level enclosing group (in the case of Melbourne, the state level grouping), we only need to specify a series of coefficients which correspond to the lowest level grouping in which two patches co-occur. Furthermore, to ensure the matrix rows sum to one, mixing is also proportional to the fraction of the population of the grouping region comprised by the patch.\nfor any two patches i and j,\ni, j are patches\nS_{i}^{L} is the set of patches in level L N_i is the population of i N_{i}^{L} is the population of S_{i}^{L} \\xi^{L}(\\delta) is the proportion of mixing that occurs within S_{i}^{L} but notS_{i}^{L-1}\nThe intra level mixing coefficients \\xi_L comprise the vector \\xi.

    "text": "5.1 Hierarchical Structure of the SA classification\nAn important feature of the SA classification structure is that there are multiples scale of classification and that lower levels of SA are hierarchically nested within higher levels. For example, several SA3 regions are contained within a single SA4 region, and multiple SA4 regions are contained within the Greater Melbourne Capital City SA (GMCCSA). Moreover, each SA3 region is partitioned into a number of SA2 scale regions (in the case of he GMCCSA, 361 of them), which in turn are divided further into (for GMCCSA, 20xx) SA1 scale regions. Figure 5.1 (b) shows the SA2, SA3, and SA4 regions of the GMCCSA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: Showing (a) the abstract structureof The Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) Statistical Areas (SA) Classification and (b) an example of SA3 and SA4 regions within the Greater Melbourne Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GMGCCSA)\n\n\nFor specific example, the Maribyrnong (SA3) region sits inside the West Melbourne (SA4) region alongside Essendon (SA3) Figure 5.2. Both West Melbourne and the neighbouring ‘Inner Melbourne’ (SA4), containing the city center and other SA3 regions, are part of the GSCCSA. Moreover, within Marybirnong (SA3) there are six SA2 level regions (Braybrook, Footscray, Maribyrnong, Seddon - Kingsville, West Footscray - Tottenham, Yarraville), which can likewise be partitioned in to smaller SA1 level and ‘Mesh Block’ level regions Figure 5.1 (a). In Figure 5.2, we highlight the SA1 region comprising the main footscray CBD (SA1 code ‘21303134811’; see Figure 5.3).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Showing the five SA3 blocks that make up the ‘Melbourne - West’ SA4 region, the six SA2 blocks that make up the Maribyrnong SA3 region, the forty SA1 regionsa that make up the ‘Footscray’ SA2 region, and the sixteen mesh blocks that make up the central Footscray ‘21303134811’ SA1 region. Note that each red-bounded area represents a higher resolution (‘lower’ SA level) than the one that encloses it. Not Pictured: Boundary of the GMGCCSA.\n\n\n\n\nHelpfully, Statistical Areas are also indexed by a structured code representing their classification hierarchy. For example, SA1 regions are denoted by an 11 digit code which can be decomposed into the higher level areas in which the region sits. Figure 5.3 demonstrates this for an SA1 region in the area considered above.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.3: Decomposition of theFootscray SA1 region code from Figure 5.2 into its hierachical spatial information components"

    "text": "5.2 Spatial resolution of metapopulation models\nWe can exploit this hierarchical structure by creating meta-population models incorporating the same overarching spatial structure (i.e. the ASGS Statistical Areas structure), but with varying levels of resolution (e.g. by using SA2 scale patches instead of SA3 scale patches). Thus, we can model the GMGCSSA using patches corresponding to different levels of the SA hierarchy.\n\nHomogenous mixing in metapopulation models\nWe might initially consider the models with patch sizes 2, 3, 4 (for SA2, SA3, SA4), and construct a mixing matrix with uniform mixing across patches, i.e. \n\\phi_{ij} = \\frac{1}{P_{tot}}\n Where P_{tot} is the total number of patches. - How should we interpret this mixing coefficient?\n\n\nProportionate mixing\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.4: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\nTo ensure equivalent representation of aggregate levels, patch population size can be used to scale mixing coefficients, i.e.. for two patches i and j the mixing coefficient \\phi_{i,j}:\n\n\\phi_{ij} = N_j/N_{tot}\n\nWhich gives mixing matrices shown in Figure 5.5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.5: Population proportional mixing matrices\n\n\nWe can implement a metapopulation model using these mixing matrices as described in chapter Chapter 2, to briefly summarise:\n\nResults: equivalent models at different spatial resolution\n-total size -peak size -Duration of pop prop models with SA2 SA3 SA4 homogeneous patches - Expect equivalence\n\n\n\nStatistical Area Mixing structure\nWe can also enforce heterogenous mixing, while simultaneously encoding the hierarchical structure of the SA classification by constructing hierarchical block mixing matrices. To do so, we specify a set of coefficients \\xi = [\\xi_1, ..., \\xi_i] such that \\sum\\limits_{i}\\xi_{i}=1, which determine the proportion of mixing occurs at each level of the spatial hierarchy. This coefficient is distributed amongst patches occurring in the same level L region, so mixing for any two patches, i and j \nM_{ij}= \\frac{\\xi_{L}}{P^{L}}\n if \nj \\in S_{i}^{L}\n but j \\notin S_{i}^{L-1} Where S_{i}^{L} is the set of patches in the same level L region as i.\nTo extend the example from ?sec-XX, we can consider a subset of SA2 regions from the GMGCCSA (Figure 5.6, (tab-MMeg?))\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5.6: ?(caption)\n\n\n\n\nDocklands and West industrial are SA2 regions within the ‘Melbourne City’ SA3 region. Port Melbourne and Port Industrial are SA2 regions within the ‘Port Melbourne’ SA3 region. Footscray, Seddon-Kingsville, and Yarraville are SA2 regions within the ‘Maribyrnong’ SA3 region. Newport SA2 is within the Hobsons Bay SA3 region. Port Melbourne and Port Industrial are SA2 regions within the ‘Port Melbourne’ SA3 region. Furthermore, both ‘Melbourne city’ and ‘Port Melbourne’ are within the ‘Inner Melbourne’ SA4 region, while Maribyrnong and Hobsons Bay SA3 lie inside the ‘West Melbourne’ SA4 Region.\nTo model mixing between these SA2 patches (isolated from the rest of the GMGCCSA), we can construct a 8 \\times 8 mixing matrix with \\xi = \\left[ \\frac{1}{4}, \\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4},\\frac{1}{4} \\right] as follows:\nlet i = Footscray. Since Footscray is it’s own SA2 region, M_{i,i} = \\frac{1}{4} When j is a region in Maribyrnong SA3 (alongside Footscray), like Yarraville or Seddon-Kingsville, M_{i,j} will be a proportion of \\xi_{SA3}. \nM_{i,j} = \\frac{\\xi_{SA3}}{P_{i}^{SA3} - P_{i}^{SA2}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{3 - 1} = \\frac{1}{8}\n When j occurs outside the Maribyrnong SA3, but within the West Melbourne SA4, like Newport SA2 \nM_{i,j} = \\frac{\\xi_{SA4}}{P_{i}^{SA4} - P_{i}^{SA3}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{4 - 3} = \\frac{1}{4}\n Finally when j is a patch outside the West Melbourne SA4, like those in the Inner MelbourneSA4 \nM_{i,j} = \\frac{\\xi_{SA5}}{P_{i}^{SA5} - P_{i}^{SA4}} = \\frac{\\frac{1}{4}}{8 - 4} = \\frac{1}{16}\n thus for the row M_{i}, representing the mixing of individuals from Footscray, \\sum\\limits_{j}M_{j}= \\frac{1}{4} +\\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{8} + \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} + \\frac{1}{16} = 1.
